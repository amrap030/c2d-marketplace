# C2D - Compute-to-Data Marketplace

This is a repository for my master thesis about enhancing blockchain-based data marketplaces with compute-to-data through verifiable off-chain computations. It uses [ZoKrates](https://github.com/Zokrates/ZoKrates) to build zero-knowledge proofs, in particular zkSNARKS, to prove to a buyer the correct computation of statistics on private datasets. The protocol additionally includes [FairSwap](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/740) as a fair data exchange protocol to guarantee a buyer receives tamper-free computation results when the seller receives the money. For more information have a look under `./thesis` to access the paper.

## üí° Get Started

Luckily, it's incredibly easy to get your development started:

```bash
# Start local hardhat blockchain node
cd src/contracts
yarn hh-node

# Deploy necessary contracts
yarn deploy

# Start all docker containers
docker compose build # in case local images are not build
docker compose up -d

# Create & deploy the subgraph indexer
cd src/subgraph
yarn create:local
yarn deploy:local

# Start the compute node & queue worker
cd src/compute-node
yarn dev
yarn worker

# Start the frontend
cd src/marketplace
yarn dev
```

## üß™ Testing

For testing the smart contracts run the following commands:

```bash
cd src/contracts
yarn test
```

> If you want to see the gas consumption for each smart contract function, set the `gasReporter` under `hardhat.config.ts` to `enabled: true` and rerun the test.
