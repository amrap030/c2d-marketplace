  abstract = {Data Marketplaces allow a wide range of public and private data providers on the one hand, and data-consuming applications on the other, to interact. They can be used to exchange valuable data relevant to a community, such as data relevant to traffic, road conditions, parking, air quality and other urban internet of things (IoT) applications, in a scalable manner. Traditionally, online marketplaces use ratings by buyers to help potential consumers identify good quality products; however such rating systems are often easy for sellers to game by paying for flattering ratings and reviews. These problems are even more challenging in data marketplaces due to the possibility of sellers launching Sybil attacks (taking on multiple fake identities) to rate their own products. We propose a novel decentralized cryptoeconomic system to ensure the credibility of reviews. The key idea of our proposed system, which can be implemented using decentralized smart contracts, is to have sellers apply for their products to be reviewed, followed by an allocation of products to a select subset of reviewers with credibility. The reviewer allocation process is randomized and double-blinded to minimize the possibility of collusion with the seller. The reviewers are incentivized through a mechanism that not only provides a reward for reviewing products posted by sellers but also an additional reward for reviewing test products posted by the marketplace. We analyze the incentive mechanism through game theoretical modeling and show conditions under which the Nash equilibrium policy is for all reviewers to perform the work needed for the review (without guessing at the answer). We also show how the staking mechanism in conjunction with high quality reviews incentivizes sellers to post higher-quality products. A marketplace with higher-quality products, in turn, is likely to have a stronger reputation and attract more customers, helping the entire ecosystem.},

Specifically, in this paper, we introduce a secure data trading ecosystem and present a new blockchain-based data trading ecosystem (hereafter referred to as SDTE). In the ecosystem, both data broker and buyer are not able to obtain access to the seller's raw data, as they are only getting access to the analysis findings that they require. In other words, we reduce the challenge of securing the dataset to the challenge to secure the data processing. We also build a security model to analyze the data trading market and describe a new set of trading protocols for the entire data trading market. To demonstrate utility, we implement our proposed secure data trading platform (SDTP) on Ethereum \& Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX) and perform an indepth analysis.},

In particular, we provide a mechanism for data providers to control the use of their data through automatic verification of data consumer contracts, allowing providers to express constraints such as pricing and differential privacy. Through smart contracts and trusted execution environments, Sterling enables privacy-preserving analytics and machine learning over private data in an efficient manner. The resulting economy ensures that the interests of all parties are aligned. For the demonstration, we highlight the use of Sterling for training machine learning models on individuals' health data. In doing so, we showcase novel approaches to automatically appraising training data, verifying and enforcing model privacy properties, and efficiently training private models on the blockchain using trusted hardware.},

It seriously affects the fair data transaction and harm the interests of both parties to the transaction. To address this issue, we propose a novel blockchain-based data trading framework with Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to provide a trusted decentralized platform for fair data trading. In our design, a blockchain network is proposed to realize the payments from data buyers to data sellers, and a trusted exchange is built by using a TEE for the first time to achieve fair data transmission. With these help, data buyers and data sellers can conduct transactions directly. We implement our proposed framework on Ethereum and Intel SGX, security analysis and experimental results have demonstrated that the framework proposed can effectively guarantee the fair completion of data tradings.},

However, current blockchainbacked IoT systems simply use the blockchain to store access control policies, thereby underutilizing the power of blockchain technology. In this paper, we propose a new framework named Sash that couples IoT platforms with blockchain that provides a number of advantages compared to state of the art. In Sash, the blockchain is used to store access control policies and take access control decisions. Therefore, both changes to policies and access requests are correctly enforced and publicly auditable. Further, we devise a ``data marketplace'' by leveraging the ability of blockchains to handle financial transaction and providing ``by design'' remuneration to data producers. Finally, we exploit a special flavor of identity-based encryption to cater for cryptography-enforced access control while minimizing the overhead to distribute decryption keys. We prototype Sash by using the FIWARE open source IoT platform and the Hyperledger Fabric framework as the blockchain back-end. We also evaluate the performance of our prototype and show that it incurs tolerable overhead in realistic deployment settings.},

Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

ZKCPlus incorporates a new commit-and-prove non-interactive zero-knowledge (CP-NIZK) argument of knowledge under standard discrete logarithmic assumption, which is prover-efficient for data-parallel computations. With this argument we avoid the setup issues of ZKCP and reduce seller's proving overhead, more importantly enable the protocol to handle complicated data validations.},

  abstract = {We introduce FairSwap \textendash{} an efficient protocol for fair exchange of digital goods using smart contracts. A fair exchange protocol allows a sender S to sell a digital commodity x for a fixed price p to a receiver R. The protocol is said to be secure if R only pays if he receives the correct x. Our solution guarantees fairness by relying on smart contracts executed over decentralized cryptocurrencies, where the contract takes the role of an external judge that completes the exchange in case of disagreement. While in the past there have been several proposals for building fair exchange protocols over cryptocurrencies, our solution has two distinctive features that makes it particular attractive when users deal with large commodities. These advantages are: (1) minimizing the cost for running the smart contract on the blockchain, and (2) avoiding expensive cryptographic tools such as zero-knowledge proofs. In addition to our new protocols, we provide formal security definitions for smart contract based fair exchange, and prove security of our construction. Finally, we illustrate several applications of our basic protocol and evaluate practicality of our approach via a prototype implementation for fairly selling large files over the cryptocurrency Ethereum.},

Further, the requirement to publish all corporate or individual information for processing at every node, essentially making the data public, is \textendash{} despite of all other advantages \textendash{} often considered a major obstacle to blockchain adoption. In this paper, we make two main contributions to address these two problems: (i) To increase efficiency, we propose a processing model which employs noninteractive proofs to off-chain computations, thereby reducing on-chain computational efforts to the verification of correctness of execution rather than the execution itself. Due to the verifiable computation scheme's zero-knowledge property, private information used in the off-chain computation does not have to become public to verify correctness. (ii) We introduce ZoKrates, a toolbox to specify, integrate and deploy such off-chain computations. It consists of a domain-specific language, a compiler, and generators for proofs and verification Smart Contracts. ZoKrates hides significant complexity inherent to zero-knowledge proofs, provides a more familiar and higher level of programming abstractions to developers and enables circuit integration, hence fostering adoption.},

Verifiable computing is a new and interesting research area that addresses this problem. Recently, new applications of verifiable computing techniques have emerged in blockchain technology for secure key management, sybil-resistance and distributed consensus, and smart contracts, while providing desired performance and privacy guarantees. In this paper, we provide an overview of common methods for verifying computation and present how they are applied to blockchain technology. We group the presented verifiable computing applications into five main application areas, i.e., multiparty approval for secure key management, sybilresistance and consensus, smart contracts and oracles, scalability, and privacy. The main contribution of this survey is to answer two research questions: 1) what are the main application areas of verifiable computing in blockchain technology, and 2) how are verifiable computing techniques used in major blockchain projects today.},

  abstract = {Blockchain technology has emerged as the cornerstone of many decentralized applications operating among otherwise untrusted peers. However, it is well known that existing blockchain systems do not scale well. Transactions are often executed and committed sequentially in order to maintain the same view of the total order. Furthermore, it is necessary to duplicate both transaction data and their executions in every node in the blockchain network for integrity assurance. Such storage and computation requirements put significant burdens on the blockchain system, not only limiting system scalability but also undermining system security and robustness by making the network more centralized. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we propose SlimChain, a novel blockchain system that scales transactions through off-chain storage and parallel processing. Advocating a stateless design, SlimChain maintains only the short commitments of ledger states on-chain while dedicating transaction executions and data storage to offchain nodes. To realize SlimChain, we propose new schemes for off-chain smart contract execution, on-chain transaction validation, and state commitment. We also propose optimizations to reduce network transmissions and a new sharding technique to improve system scalability further. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed SlimChain system. Compared with the existing systems, SlimChain reduces the on-chain storage requirements by 97\% \textasciitilde{} 99\%, while also improving the peak throughput by 1.4X \textasciitilde{} 15.6X.},

In this paper, we propose PrivacyGuard, a system that leverages blockchain smart contract and trusted execution environment (TEE) to enable individual's control over the access and usage of their private data. Smart contracts are used to specify data usage policy, i.e., who can use what data under which conditions and what analytics to perform, while the distributed blockchain ledger is used to keep an irreversible and non-repudiable data usage record. To address the efficiency problem of on-chain contract execution and to prevent exposing private data on the publicly viewable blockchain, PrivacyGuard incorporates a novel TEE-based off-chain contract execution engine along with a protocol to securely commit the execution result onto blockchain. We have built and deployed a prototype of PrivacyGuard with Ethereum and Intel SGX. Our experiment result demonstrates that PrivacyGuard fulfills the promised privacy goal and supports analytics on data from a considerable number of data owners.},

In particular, we provide a mechanism for data providers to control the use of their data through automatic verification of data consumer contracts, allowing providers to express constraints such as pricing and differential privacy. Through smart contracts and trusted execution environments, Sterling enables privacy-preserving analytics and machine learning over private data in an efficient manner. The resulting economy ensures that the interests of all parties are aligned. For the demonstration, we highlight the use of Sterling for training machine learning models on individuals' health data.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack on two case studies: RSA decryption and genomic processing. While cache timing attacks against RSA and other cryptographic operations can be prevented by using appropriately hardened crypto libraries, the same cannot be easily done for other computations, such as genomic processing. Our second case study therefore shows that attacks on noncryptographic but privacy sensitive operations are a serious threat.

Even when the applications of ZKPs were endless, they were not exploited in the wild for a couple of decades due to the fact that computing and verifying proofs was too computationally expensive. However, the advent of efficient schemes (in particular, zk-SNARKs) made this primitive to break into the scene in fields like cryptocurrencies, smart-contracts, and more recently, selfsovereign scenarios: private-by-design identity management and authentication. Nevertheless, its adoption in environments like the Internet of Things (IoT) remains unexplored due to the computational limitations of embedded systems. In this paper, we introduce ZPiE, a C library intended to create ZKP applications to be executed in embedded systems. Its main feature is portability: it can be compiled, executed, and used outof-the-box in a wide variety of devices. Moreover, our proof-of-concept has been proved to work smoothly in different devices with limited resources, which can execute state-of-the-art ZKP authentication protocols.},

Zerocoin (Miers et al., IEEE S\&P 2013) tackles some of these privacy issues by unlinking transactions from the payment's origin. Yet it still reveals payment destinations and amounts, and is limited in functionality.},

To this end, we introduce Pinocchio, a built system for efficiently verifying general computations while relying only on cryptographic assumptions. With Pinocchio, the client creates a public evaluation key to describe her computation; this setup is proportional to evaluating the computation once. The worker then evaluates the computation on a particular input and uses the evaluation key to produce a proof of correctness. The proof is only 288 bytes, regardless of the computation performed or the size of the inputs and outputs. Anyone can use a public verification key to check the proof.},

In many systems each client downloads and verifies every new proof, and so proofs must be small and cheap to verify. The most practical schemes require either a trusted setup, as in (pre-processing) zk-SNARKs, or verification complexity that scales linearly with the complexity of the relation, as in Bulletproofs. The structured reference strings required by most zkSNARK schemes can be constructed with multi-party computation protocols, but the resulting parameters are specific to an individual relation. Groth et al. discovered a zk-SNARK protocol with a universal structured reference string that is also updatable, but the string scales quadratically in the size of the supported relations.},

We use our methodology to obtain a preprocessing zkSNARK where the SRS has linear size and arguments have constant size. Our construction improves on Sonic [Maller et al., CCS 2019], the prior state of the art in this setting, in all efficiency parameters: proving is an order of magnitude faster and verification is thrice as fast, even with smaller SRS size and argument size. Our construction is most efficient when instantiated in the algebraic group model (also used by Sonic), but we also demonstrate how to realize it under concrete knowledge assumptions.

Our methodology does not rely on any special algebraic objects and, moreover, achieves new desirable properties: it is post-quantum and it is transparent (the setup is public coin). We exploit the fact that recursive composition is simpler for SNARKs with preprocessing, and the core of our work is obtaining a preprocessing zkSNARK for rank-1 constraint satisfiability (R1CS) that is post-quantum and transparent. We obtain this latter by establishing a connection between holography and preprocessing in the random oracle model, and then constructing a holographic proof for R1CS.},

Increasingly efficient protocols have been described in recent years, with verification time and/or communication complexity that is sublinear in the size of the computation being described. These efficiencies can be exploited to realize recursive proof composition: the concept of proofs that attest to the correctness of other instances of themselves, thereby allowing large computational effort to be incrementally verified. All previously known realizations of recursive proof composition have required a trusted setup and cycles of expensive pairing-friendly elliptic curves. We obtain and implement Halo, the first practical example of recursive proof composition without a trusted setup, using the discrete log assumption over normal cycles of elliptic curves. In the process we develop several novel techniques that may be of independent interest.},

Objectives and principles for the design of these systems are derived from legal principles, economic theory, and theories of reliable and secure protocols. Similarities and differences between smart contracts and traditional business procedures based on written contracts, controls, and static forms are discussed. By using cryptographic and other security mechanisms, we can secure many algorithmically specifiable relationships from breach by principals, and from eavesdropping or malicious interference by third parties, up to considerations of time, user interface, and completeness of the algorithmic specification. This article discusses protocols with application in important contracting areas, including credit, content rights management, payment systems, and contracts with bearer.}
