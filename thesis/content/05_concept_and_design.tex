BASED ON ZERO_TRUST PRINCIPLES NENNEN?!?! DAPP NENNEN?, SERVICE ORIENTED ARCHITECTURE, MICROSERVICES, DECOUPLING

This section defines the main components of the proposed decentralized, blockchain-based data marketplace. Although it can be run by any central party or deployed on any cloud infrastructure, it is intended to be deployed on the operator's own local on-premises infrastructure. This eliminates trust in central servers and ensures great control over the data, as it never leaves the operator's premises. It also provides excellent flexibility, as each operator can scale its own infrastructure independently, deploying only the components he or she needs. The complete software stack, as shown in figure \ref{fig:arch}, consists of a full Ethereum node, a blockchain indexer, an IPFS node, a compute microservice, a crypto microservice, a message queue, and an API gateway.

\subsection{Ethereum Full Node}

An Ethereum full node is a piece of hardware, most often a consumer-grade computer, that runs the client software to download an entire copy of the Ethereum blockchain. It is connected to other nodes, forming a geographically diverse decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network, and is responsible for verifying the validity of all blocks and transactions. To interact with the blockchain, users need to sign transactions with their wallet and send them to an RPC node. However, most wallets point to a public RPC node, such as Infura\footnote{https://www.infura.io/} or Alchemy\footnote{https://www.alchemy.com/}, which is considered a centralized trusted third party and often involves additional usage costs. This inevitably leads to a number of problems.

First, any transaction sent to a public RPC endpoint poses a privacy and security risk, as they can potentially leak balances and other personal information by linking an IP address to an Ethereum account address. In addition, public RPC endpoints could even reject or manipulate transactions, making it impossible to interact with the blockchain. Furthermore, centralized solutions provide an attack surface for malicious actors, disrupting the network and leading to a single point of failure.

The implementation of own Ethereum full nodes aligns well with zero trust principles and allows to interact with the blockchain in a trustless, privacy-preserving, and secure manner. It eliminates censorship and single point of failure while making the network more reliable, robust, and geographically diverse. Likewise, it is relatively easy and affordable to deploy an Ethereum full node. Although not recommended, it could even run on a lightweight single-board computer (SBC) such as a Raspberry Pi with enough external storage.

\subsection{Decentralized Application}

A \acrfull{dapp} is an application, that relies on decentralized networks, such as a blockchain, to execute backend application logic and to persist data. In this thesis, the \acrshort{dapp} consists of a frontend user interface that is connected to smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, more specifically the \acrshort{evm}. All smart contracts are responsible for executing the protocols in the marketplace in a trustless and censorship-resistant manner with full data integrity, as data stored on the blockchain is immutable. However, it only stores a minimum necessary amount of data to avoid blockchain bloating. Larger amounts of data are stored on other immutable decentralized storages such as IPFS, as described in section \ref{subsec:ipfs}, while leaving a related pointer on the blockchain according to the Content-Addressable Storage Pattern \cite{eberhardtBlockchainInsightsOffChaining2017}

The user interface is the main component for users to interact with the marketplace, i.e. creating computation algorithms, offering computations on private datasets, browsing and filtering the marketplace for interesting offerings as well as making purchases. It is responsible for providing a holistic seamless user experience, however, this is harder to engineer compared to traditional user interfaces, as it introduces a steep learning curve for end-users to understand wallets, transactions, or gas fees among others. In the real world, it is often seen that the frontend part of a \acrshort{dapp} is hosted on centralized cloud servers. However, to be fully decentralized, \acrshort{dapp}s can also be hosted on decentralized \acrshort{p2p} networks such as IPFS, but, the initial loading time could be negatively affected, resulting in a poor user experience. In the proposed marketplace, it is not necessary to host the frontend on IPFS, as each operator hosts its own version of the frontend and doesn't need to trust any centralized servers.
            
\subsection{Blockchain Indexer}
\label{subsec:indexer}

Public permissionless blockchains like Ethereum are completely transparent and readable by anyone. It is a ledger of multiple transactions in a time-ordered, append-only data structure that is highly inefficient to query, filter, search, paginate, and aggregate. However, this is the bare minimum of functionality for an application to be useful. For example, in the proposed marketplace, consumers want to find interesting offers and apply filters by tags to reduce the number of results. To find this information on-chain, the application would have to traverse millions of blocks on the ledger. This is highly inefficient and time-consuming, leading to poor user experience, as users are used to rapid response times in regular applications.

The proposed marketplace solves this problem by implementing a blockchain indexer. This indexer listens to each newly created block and extracts raw data from a blockchain node, processes it, and stores it in a relational database. It then provides access to token metadata, offers, orders, accounts, and all sorts of marketplace events. The indexer is even able to store IPFS data directly within entities of the database, which eliminates additional network roundtrips on the client. Data is exposed via a standard API to provide highly efficient and fast access to on-chain data with all the required querying, filtering, searching, pagination, and aggregation capabilities. This not only improves the user experience but also the development experience, as developers are used to standard APIs rather than querying the blockchain or writing SQL queries.

However, the majority of \acrshort{dapp}'s are connected to public centralized blockchain indexers, which may be unavailable in the event of network partitioning. In addition, public blockchain indexers typically receive huge amounts of traffic, resulting in throttled performance and high response times to a client. They are also a trusted third party and a \acrfull{spof}, as they are easily attacked by fraudulent parties. In the proposed marketplace, each deployment includes its own blockchain indexer to eliminate the aforementioned aspects without trusting any public centralized service.
            
\subsection{IPFS Node}
\label{subsec:ipfs}

Storing large amounts of data on the blockchain is very expensive and limited due to block size and gas limitations. For this reason, the proposed marketplace requires a large number of files to be stored on \emph{off-chain} storage. Typical off-chain storage services such as Amazon AWS S3\footnote{https://aws.amazon.com/de/s3/}, Azure Blob Storage\footnote{https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/storage/blobs/} and Google Cloud Storage\footnote{https://cloud.google.com/storage} are easy to use, but they have some significant drawbacks. A cloud storage service is a trusted central third-party system that can be very expensive, vulnerable to cyber-attacks, and unavailable in the event of network partitioning. It also poses a vendor lock-in, making it difficult and costly to switch. Likewise, data stored on cloud storage is not immutable.

The \acrfull{ipfs} is a decentralized peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol for storing and accessing content-addressable files in a distributed file system. An \acrshort{ipfs} node can expose an API to write chunks to the node, and a gateway to read files from the node. While it is possible to leverage public \acrshort{ipfs} nodes, they can represent a single point of failure, just like any cloud storage service. For this reason, each deployment of the proposed marketplace includes an \acrshort{ipfs} node connected to the public \acrshort{ipfs} network. This not only strengthens the network and makes it more geographically diverse, but also replicates and caches files on other nodes, resulting in highly available data. In the proposed marketplace, token metadata, computation algorithms, and evidence key pairs are stored on the \acrshort{ipfs} node and addressable by a \acrfull{cid} that is stored on the blockchain. A \acrshort{cid} is an absolute pointer to the content, similar to a hash of a file, making the content behind the \acrshort{cid} immutable and unique.
            
\subsection{Compute Service}
\label{subsec:compute}

The compilation of zero-knowledge programs, the trusted setup, and the proof generation with ZoKrates is a computationally and memory-intensive process, especially for large amounts of data. Accordingly, it may be necessary to have a dedicated, powerful machine with enough CPU cores and memory to perform these computations. This is ensured by a dedicated compute microservice that can be scaled either horizontally or vertically to meet individual compute requirements. In order to make the microservice API non-blocking, jobs are sent to a message queue. Workers then accept and execute jobs in the background in a separate process on the machine to run in parallel and to be individually scalable. In addition, ZoKrates is executed in another child process on the machine to make better use of the underlying hardware, rather than being implemented as a library. When a job is finished, clients are notified by the compute microservice.

\subsection{S3 Storage}
\label{subsec:s3}

Because computations in the compute service are very expensive in terms of memory and CPU usage, as well as time-consuming, it is beneficial to avoid unnecessary computations. Therefore, compiled constraint systems, witnesses, and generated proofs belonging to a sale or a purchase are stored in the seller's and consumer's own S3 instance. In this way, recurring computations can be avoided by first verifying if a computation has already been done and if assets already exist in the associated S3 bucket.

\subsection{Crypto Service}
\label{subsec:crypto}

The fair exchange protocol in the proposed marketplace must handle proofs of misbehavior, which require the construction and reconstruction of Merkle trees, as well as the generation of Merkle tree inclusion proofs. It also needs to encrypt computation results before a consumer accepts an order, and decrypt them when the consumer pays the price for a computation. All this is done by a dedicated crypto service that exposes an API to the client.

\subsection{API Gateway}
\label{subsec:api_gw}

In the proposed marketplace, raw datasets never leave the seller's boundaries to protect PII and confidential data. Instead, buyers can only receive computational results. This data exchange must take place through a secure public channel, i.e. the API gateway. Unlike all other components, the API gateway sits on the public subnet to be accessible by any other marketplace participant. It is the single entry point to the seller's infrastructure, acting as a reverse proxy to route incoming requests to the appropriate microservices on the private subnet. In the proposed marketplace, the API gateway has routes to the compute service, the crypto service, and the blockchain indexer. In addition to routing, it also performs request rate limiting and authorization decisions in a dedicated sidecar container close to the API gateway to avoid internal latency-intensive network calls

\section{Data Sources}
\label{section:datasource}

%This thesis presents the implementation of a practical real world data marketplace for verifiable statistical computations on private datasets. It addresses \emph{Privacy}, \emph{Fairness} and \emph{Regulation} problems of blockchain-based data trading platforms, while the focus is on \emph{Privacy}. \emph{Furthermore, I only focus on static tabular datasets with very infrequent changes. Hence, I do \textbf{not} focus on real-time streaming data and training of machine-learning models}. My proposed implementation implicitly targets the \emph{Data Transfer} and \emph{Payment} process as well as \emph{IAM} -- some of the fundamental functional requirements, as already depicted in Figure \ref{fig:components}. Specifically, I construct a secure blockchain-based data trading ecosystem, using Blockchain as a medium to (i.) prevent single-point of failure; (ii.) define data usage policies; (iii.) create a transparent, non-repudiable and tamper-proof log of transactions; and (iv.) enforce a fair data exchange protocol. However, the \emph{focus} of this thesis is rather on creating a generic mechanism to make a variety of computations on arbitrary private datasets verifiable, and Blockchain is a necessary part of the puzzle. This thesis uses Verifiable Off-chain Computation (VOC) to address this problem \cite{eberhardtOffchainingModelsApproaches2018,eberhardtBlockchainInsightsOffChaining2017}.

%VOC is a derivative of Verifiable Computation and aims to secure the integrity of computations performed by untrusted parties off the Blockchain. The result of the computation is then published to the Blockchain and verified on-chain with a cryptographic proof, attesting its correctness. Off-loading the computation has multiple benefits -- (i.) it increases the scalability by avoiding complex redundant computations on each node; (ii.) it reduces on-chain transaction costs by significantly lowering the size of transactions; and (iii.) it improves privacy by hiding PII and confidential data from the public ledger. \cite{eberhardtOffchainingModelsApproaches2018,eberhardtZoKratesScalablePrivacyPreserving2018a,simunicVerifiableComputingApplications2021,xuSlimChainScalingBlockchain} 

%According to \cite{eberhardtOffchainingModelsApproaches2018}, a reasonable VC scheme for off-chain computations needs to fulfill the following requirements: (i.) non-interactivity; (ii.) cheap verification; (iii.) weak security assumptions; and (iv.) zero-knowledge. ZkSNARKs, ZkSTARKs and Bulletproofs provide a valid approach to the aforementioned requirements. ZkSNARKs are a type of Zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) that are \emph{non-interactive} and \emph{succinct}. \emph{Non-interactivity} defines the possibility to convince a verifier of a particular statement with only \emph{one} message \cite{eberhardtOffchainingModelsApproaches2018,eberhardtZoKratesScalablePrivacyPreserving2018a,simunicVerifiableComputingApplications2021}. \emph{Succinct} defines a proof that is small in size, compared to ZkSTARKs and Bulletproofs, and can be verified cheaply and quickly, typically within a few milliseconds \cite{simunicVerifiableComputingApplications2021}. This thesis uses a ZKP with ZkSNARKs for verifiable computations on private datasets.

%The proposed blockchain-based data trading platform is designed for two party relationships between a buyer \emph{B} and seller \emph{S}. The current high-level protocol for a trade between \emph{B} and \emph{S} on the proposed platform is described by the following exemplary use case and shown in the subsequent Figure \ref{fig:usecase}, without technical details.

%\begin{figure}[!htb]

%    \label{fig:usecase}
%\end{figure}

%\subsubsection{Example}

%S advertises a dataset $x$ about health information of a population on the marketplace. The dataset $x$ is described by metadata, i.e. the time interval, data category, amount of columns and rows as well as the header of each column, among other metadata. The actual content of the dataset is hidden from the buyer. A potential \emph{B} enters the data marketplace and is interested in receiving the average age of cancer diagnosed patients in 2021. He or she discovers a promising dataset $x$ of \emph{S} in the health category, containing all cancer diagnosed patients worldwide. \emph{B} chooses to purchase the desired computation $\phi(x)$ for the \emph{age} column. He or she commits the purchase by an on-chain transaction, including the given price by \emph{S}. All coins are now temporarily locked in a smart contract. \emph{S} subsequently gets notified by the purchase and calculates the average on a private node of \emph{S}, protecting privacy and confidentiality of \emph{S}'s dataset. \emph{S} transfers the result $z = Enc_{pb(B)}(y=\phi(x))$ to the Blockchain, encrypted with the public key of \emph{B}. \emph{B} gets notified and decrypts the result with his or her private key $Dec_{sk(B)}(z)$. \emph{B} is now uncertain about the correctness of the result and therefore constructs a program $\pi$ for the seller to prove (i.) the correctness of the computation; (ii.) the result originates from the advertised dataset; and (iii.) the proof is given by the seller. He or she then publishes a smart contract for the verification of the proof. \emph{S} is now responsible to generate such a proof for the verifier smart contract, to transparently proof all the requirements of $\pi$. According to that, the execution of the protocol terminates in the following situations:

%\newpage
%\begin{enumerate}
%    \item \emph{S} finally manages to submit a valid proof to the verifier contract. In this case, the payment is released to \emph{S}.
 %   \item \emph{S} does not publish a computation result. In this case, \emph{B} can withdraw his payment after a timeout. \textbf{(Scenario A)}
 %   \item \emph{B} does not construct a proving program and does not publish the proving key to \emph{S}. In this case, \emph{S} can withdraw the payment after a timeout. \textbf{(Scenario B)}
 %   \item \emph{S} is not able to submit a valid proof to the verifier contract. In this case, \emph{B} can withdraw his payment after a timeout. \textbf{(Scenario C)}
%\end{enumerate}

%\noindent \textbf{Note}: This protocol is only a first idea and the final protocol may highly differ. At the time of writing this exposé I already noticed that there is one major weakness in the current protocol. A malicious \emph{B} could send a fake proving key to \emph{S}, so that it is impossible for \emph{S} to construct a valid proof. According to that, \emph{B} would always be able to withdraw his payment, if he has no honest interest in actually verifying the correctness of his purchased values. While this is not the focus of this thesis, I will try to create a completely trustless protocol between \emph{B} and \emph{S}.
